---

This mod prevents blocks dropped on the floor from being blown up by explosions.<br>
This happens by checking the dropped item block's resistance against the explosion strength, similar to how in world blocks resist explosions.

The following 2 tags are implement with this mod, they can only be applied to blocks.
`itemresistance:force_explode` - Forces blocks to always explode, no matter the resistance of the block itself.
`itemresistance:force_resist` - Forces blocks to always resist explosions, no matter the resistance of the block itself.
